# Introductory HTML

**In the Upcoming class will be discussing The following:**

1. **HTML** *structure*
2. **HTML** *Extra Markup*
3. **HTML5** *Layout*
4. **HTML** *Procecc and Design*

**Let us start with:**
#### 1. HTML*Structure*

*The idea behinde it is when you see electronic version of a Newspaper, The question that will come to mind, How they transfer it to an electronial copy, We will find the answer, Here! Using HTML.*

*Using HTML we Could copy the structure we see in the normal life of the newspaper and change it to a code. using these in a proper way will give us the initial structure infront of us but without colors without backgrounds.*

**So here we can say that HTML describe the structre of pages, But how?**
*The HTML language has a spasific elements, tags, attributes to use it and to describe pages.* **And here is an example to do code in HTML, It is clear that HTML has its own structure as well**
*< html >* 
*< body >*
 *< h1 >This is the Main Heading</ h1 >*
 *< p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of*
 *the page. And if the page is a long one it might*
 *be split up into several sub-headings.< p>*
 *< h2>This is a Sub-Heading</ h2>*
 *< p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help*
 *you follow the structure of what is being written.*
 *There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level*
 *headings).< /p>*
 *< h2>Another Sub-Heading</ h2>*
*< p>Here you can see another sub-heading.< /p>*
*< /body>*
*< /html>*

*The HTML characters between angle brackets called elements, and the angle brackets with the characters inside them called tags, we have two tags, opening tag and closing tag.*

***Let us summerize what we mentiond before:***

>*HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages*
>*Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.*
> Attributes lie in the opening tag, and it gives us more information about the content of an elemets, for example the type and we have to sit a vlue (type="text").

### Summary
 ***HTML structre:***
> HTML uses tags (< p >, < h1 >) to give the information they surround    special meaning.

> HTML pages are text documents.

> Tags usually come in pairs opening tags (< charachter >) and closing tag ( < / charachter >).

> Opening tags can contain attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. and shoud identify name and value.

#### 2. HTML *Extra Markup*

we are heading to cover different subjects and extra markup in HTML as the following :

. The different versions of HTML and how to indicate which
  version you are using.

. How to add comments to your code.

. Global attributes, which are attributes that can be used on
  any element, including the class and id attributes.

. Elements that are used to group together parts of the page
  where no other element is suitable.

. How to embed a page within a page using iframes.

. How to add information about the web page using the
< meta > element.

. Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright
  symbols.

**Note:** 
*Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a **DOCTYPE declaration** to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.* 
**Note:**
*It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, when you come back to it later, comments will make it much easier to understand.* 

### Summary
 ***HTML Extra Markup:***
> DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

> We Could add comments to our code between the
< !-- and -- > markers.

> The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements and make it esier to call it in another file for example CSS file.

> The < div>  elements allow you to group block together and and < span> allow you to group inline elements together.

> < iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed. and it is similar somehow when we use links and target it like _blank or something else.

> The < meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

> Escape characters allows you to use some symbols lie the copywritght symbol or tademark .. etc.

#### 3. HTML Layout 
*In the old versions they were using div tag make their layouts within one page, now in HTML5 There is tags do this just by writing it.*

*In HTML5 You can you use new layout elements and allow you to replace it instead of div element. so you will get more esily to track the long codes and it has many benefits as well.*

**Exaples** for layout elements we could use them instead of div elemen
 ( Header, nav, section, article, aside...etc).

 **Note:** *each layout or each elements of the elements we have mentiond above could take its own header.*

### Summary:
***HTML layout:***
> The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

> The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <   div> elements).

> Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

> To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

#### 4. **HTML** *Procecc and Design*

. How to approach building a site
. Understanding your audience and their needs
. How to present information visitors want to see

**When you Start Building and designing your website You need to idintify and understand:**
*1. who your target audienceis.*
*2. why they would come to your site.* 
*3. what information they want to find and when they are likely to return*

**Notes:** 
> Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
> Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
> Design is about communication. help visitors  to understand what you are trying to tell them.
> You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
> You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
