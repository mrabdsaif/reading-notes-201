#### Images :
**We can add images to our html doc, but the matter is, how to style it, how to choose the right format and how to optimize it to suit your web page.**

* Firstly, To add an image we use an empty element, and thats mean, a tag has no closing tag, <img>, inside this tag we need to add the image source.
* Then we add (alt) which is contain a description about the image. 
* We can add the title attribute as well to add an additional text.

>  * We can change the dimention of an image using the width and the       height,images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and  height that you want them to appear on the page.

> * Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new <figure>     element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated. 
The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

> * You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

> * Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

#### Colors :

> * Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

> * There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

> * Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

> * It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

> * CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

> * You can specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


#### Text :

> * There are properties to control the choice of  your font  and these properties are  size, weight, style, and spacing.
*the font size, the weight: bold or any other choice, The style: Italic...*

> * There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

> * If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

> * You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words.

> * Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

> * You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
